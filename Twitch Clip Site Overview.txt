Goals:
    Create a database of the twitch clips either by hand (sucks) or Twitch Bot (possible but needs auth) if needed format data to something more useable format
    Create a web front app for searching through the data
    Ideal features would be searching by Clipper, Date, Game (Maybe not possible for old clips, twitch incorrectly labeled clips for ages) and if scaled, Broadcaster
    If a bot is made and ran on the channel extra info like views, thumbnails etc should be easier to pull and display
